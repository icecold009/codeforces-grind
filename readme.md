## 🎯 Getting Started

1. **Start with fundamentals**: Begin with 800-900 rated problems to build confidence
2. **Study concepts**: Review relevant notes before tackling problem categories
3. **Use templates**: Leverage provided templates for faster development
4. **Track progress**: Monitor your learning journey in `notes/progress.md`

## 💡 Key Topics Covered

- ✅ Fundamentals (arrays, strings, loops)
- ✅ Search algorithms (binary search, linear search)
- ✅ Dynamic programming
- ✅ Graph algorithms
- ✅ Mathematical problem solving
- ✅ Common competitive programming patterns

## 🏆 Practice Tips

> "The only way to master competitive programming is through consistent practice and learning from mistakes."

1. **Understand before coding** - Read and understand the problem completely
2. **Optimize gradually** - Get a working solution first, then optimize
3. **Review solutions** - Learn from efficient approaches to similar problems
4. **Track mistakes** - Document what went wrong to avoid repeating them
5. **Study patterns** - Recognize problem categories and applicable techniques

## 📊 Progress Tracking

See [notes/progress.md](notes/progress.md) to monitor:
- Problems solved by difficulty
- Topics mastered
- Learning milestones
- Areas for improvement

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Languages**: C++, Python
- **Platform**: Codeforces
- **Tools**: Custom scripts for problem generation and testing

## 📝 Notes Structure

Each topic note includes:
- Concept explanation
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Common patterns and variations
- Example problems from this repository
- Practice recommendations

## 🎓 Learning Path

```
Fundamentals (800-900)
    ↓
Core Algorithms (1000-1100)
    ↓
Advanced Techniques (1200-1300)
    ↓
Mastery Level (1400+)
```

## 📌 Quick Reference

### C++ Template Usage
```bash
./scripts/generate_problem.sh <problem_id>
# Then edit the generated file in problems/<rating>/
```

### Common Time Limits
- 1-2 seconds: O(n log n) typically passes
- 2-3 seconds: O(n²) for n ≤ 5000
- For n ≤ 10⁶: Use O(n) or O(n log n) solutions
